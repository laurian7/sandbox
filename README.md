sandbox
=======

This is a sandbox to experiment with tools, processes and procedures before integrating them into main open source projects elsewhere.

There is no point in following this repo as it will always be unstable and only as relevant as the scope of the immediate instant. Having said that, cool, great to see you ... possibly again :-)
